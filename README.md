Axiomatic intelligence. Provably correct reasoning by traversing and composing ontologies. Define rules as category theory, enforce them as axioms, verify with property-based testing. From chess to quantum mechanics to natural language — if the rules can be stated, praxis proves they hold.

1353 proofs across physics, chess, music theory, linguistics, and more execute in under a second on a single core.

## Architecture

Praxis has five layers. Each layer depends only on the layers below it.

```
praxis::logic        — Axioms, propositions, inference (deduction, induction, abduction)
praxis::category     — Entity, Relationship, Category, Functor, Morphism
praxis::ontology     — Ontology, Quality, Reasoning, Upper Ontology (DOLCE)
praxis::engine       — Situation, Action, Precondition, Engine, Trace
praxis::codegen      — Build-time ontology generation from data sources
```

| Layer | Module | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Logic** | `praxis::logic` | Axioms, propositions, truth tables, inference (deduction, induction, abduction) |
| **Category** | `praxis::category` | Entity, Relationship, Category, Functor, NaturalTransformation — the mathematics |
| **Ontology** | `praxis::ontology` | Ontology, Quality, Reasoning (7 association types), Upper Ontology (DOLCE-aligned) |
| **Engine** | `praxis::engine` | Situation, Action, Precondition, Engine, Trace — how things CHANGE |
| **Codegen** | `praxis::codegen` | Build-time ontology generation from external data (feature-gated) |

### Reasoning Ontology

Seven association types formalize how concepts relate. Each is a reusable category pattern with axioms and query functions:

| Association | What it models | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Taxonomy** (is-a) | Hierarchical subsumption | Dog is-a Mammal is-a Animal |
| **Mereology** (has-a) | Part-whole relationships | Car has-a Engine has-a Piston |
| **Causation** (causes) | Causal chains | Heating causes Boiling causes Steam |
| **Analogy** (is-like) | Structure-preserving maps | Electric field is-like Gravitational field |
| **Equivalence** (synonymy) | Interchangeability | Big = Large = Huge |
| **Opposition** (antonymy) | Semantic negation | Hot opposes Cold |
| **Context** (disambiguation) | Meaning selection by signal | "bank" + money = finance; "bank" + river = riverbank |

### Upper Ontology (DOLCE)

Praxis classifies everything that exists using categories from [DOLCE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01597) (Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering):

| Being | What it is | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **Physical Endurant** | Tangible, persists | Traffic light, elevator |
| **Social Object** | Exists by agreement | Chess rules, XML spec, English language, legal system |
| **Mental Object** | Exists in cognition | Concept, belief, intention |
| **Abstract Object** | Timeless | Number, mathematical proof, category |
| **Event** | Instantaneous | A chess move, a key press |
| **Process** | Extended over time | A chess game, a trial, a conversation |
| **Quality** | Measurable property | Color, weight, pitch |

A functor from praxis's type system to DOLCE proves the alignment preserves structure (identity and composition laws verified).

### Ontology Evolution Pattern

When transforming ontologies, praxis doesn't rewrite — it creates the new ontology alongside the old and proves the mapping via functor. The functor guarantees structure preservation. This pattern applies to every ontology migration: domain restructuring, upper ontology alignment, language translation, format conversion.

## Quick Start

```rust
use praxis::engine::{Engine, Situation, Action, Precondition};
use praxis_domains::technology::games::chess::{new_game, ChessAction, Square};

// Play chess with full rule enforcement
let game = new_game()
    .next(ChessAction::new(Square::new(4, 1), Square::new(4, 3)))? // e4
    .next(ChessAction::new(Square::new(4, 6), Square::new(4, 4)))?; // e5

game.situation()       // current board
game.back()?           // undo
game.forward()?        // redo
game.trace().dump()    // full history
```

## Proofs

| Equivalence transitivity | Big = Large = Huge (transitive closure) |
| Opposition exclusivity | Antonyms cannot be synonyms |
| DOLCE functor laws | Praxis→DOLCE mapping preserves identity and composition |
| Subject-verb agreement | "the dog runs" valid; "the dog run" rejected |

## Philosophical Foundation

Praxis draws from three intellectual traditions:

- **Category theory** — the mathematics of composition. Objects, morphisms, functors, natural transformations provide the formal structure.
- **DOLCE** (Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering) — the philosophical classification of being. Everything is Endurant (persists), Perdurant (happens), or Quality (measurable).
- **Systems thinking and cybernetics** — the science of wholes, feedback, and self-regulation. The Engine is a cybernetic control loop. Metacognition is second-order cybernetics.

### Principles

- **Nothing mechanical.** If praxis interacts with data, it must understand that data through an ontology. No blind parsing.
- **Ontology evolution via functor.** When transforming ontologies, create the new one alongside, prove the mapping via functor, save the transformation. Never rewrite.
- **Rich types, not enums with options.** Domain entities carry their structure in the type system. A Noun is structurally different from a Verb.
- **Nothing in the README until there's a proof.** This document describes only what the codebase demonstrates.
