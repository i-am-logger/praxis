// Adjunction — a pair of functors that are "optimally inverse."
//
// Given categories C and D, an adjunction F ⊣ G consists of:
// - Left adjoint F: C → D (the "free" functor)
// - Right adjoint G: D → C (the "forgetful" functor)
//
// The defining property: for all objects A in C and B in D,
//   Hom_D(F(A), B) ≅ Hom_C(A, G(B))
//
// This natural bijection means: a morphism F(A) → B in D
// corresponds uniquely to a morphism A → G(B) in C.
//
// Adjunctions are everywhere in praxis:
// - Parse ⊣ Generate — parsing text to semantics, generating text from semantics
// - Channel ⊣ Decode — noisy channel corruption, Bayesian correction
// - Abstract ⊣ Concretize — moving between abstraction levels
// - Forget ⊣ Free — forgetting structure, freely generating structure
//
// The unit η: Id_C → G∘F and counit ε: F∘G → Id_D capture the
// information loss: G∘F ≠ Id (you can't perfectly recover from
// the round trip), but η and ε are the "best approximation."
