/// The DOLCE-inspired upper ontology: types of being.
///
/// DOLCE (Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering) classifies
/// everything that exists into fundamental categories based on how they exist in time
/// and what kind of thing they are.
///
/// Reference: Masolo et al., "WonderWeb Deliverable D18" (2003);
/// Borgo et al., "DOLCE: A Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering" (2022).
///
/// # Categories
///
/// ## Endurant (persists through time — has identity over time)
/// - **PhysicalEndurant**: tangible objects (a traffic light, an elevator, a circuit board)
/// - **SocialObject**: exists by agreement/convention (chess rules, XML spec, a legal system, a language)
/// - **MentalObject**: exists in cognition (a concept, a belief, an intention)
/// - **AbstractObject**: timeless, non-temporal (a number, a mathematical proof, a category)
///
/// ## Perdurant (happens over time — has temporal parts)
/// - **Event**: instantaneous or near-instantaneous (a chess move, a key press, a ruling)
/// - **Process**: extended over time (a chess game, a trial, a conversation, a computation)
///
/// ## Quality (measurable property inhering in another entity)
/// - **Quality**: a perceivable/measurable attribute (color, weight, pitch, temperature)
///
/// # Why DOLCE?
///
/// DOLCE was designed specifically for linguistic and cognitive engineering —
/// exactly what praxis does. It provides the classification that our original
/// Entity trait was missing: not just "a thing that can be enumerated" but
/// "what TYPE of thing is this?"
