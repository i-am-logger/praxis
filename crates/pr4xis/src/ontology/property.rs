/// DOLCE quality classification (Masolo et al. 2003 *WonderWeb D18*).
///
/// DOLCE splits qualities by the kind of being-aspect they describe:
/// physical properties (mass, color, length), temporal ones (duration,
/// instant), spatial ones (position, orientation, shape), abstract ones
/// (names, identifiers, numerical values), and social ones (roles,
/// permissions, obligations).
///
/// Each `Quality` impl declares its kind via the [`Quality::KIND`] const.
/// Default is `Abstract` — the most conservative classification for
/// qualities without an explicit physical/temporal/spatial/social
/// realisation.
///
/// # Literature

/// A quality — an attribute that inheres in an individual (DOLCE/BFO).

/// Per Aristotle's *Categories* (translated in Ackrill 1963) and DOLCE
/// (Masolo 2003 §4.3): a quality is an entity that cannot exist
/// independently — it must inhere in something else. The relation is
/// `quality hasQuality individual` / `individual hasQuality quality`.
///
/// In pr4xis, each `Quality` impl is a partial function from individuals
/// (of the associated `Concept` type) to values in a `QualitySpace`
/// (the `Value` type). The DOLCE classification is captured by
/// [`KIND`](Quality::KIND).
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```ignore
/// impl Quality for Brightness {
///     type Individual = Lamp;
///     type Value = u8;
///     const KIND: QualityKind = QualityKind::Physical;
///     fn get(&self, l: &Lamp) -> Option<u8> { Some(l.brightness) }
/// }
/// ```
