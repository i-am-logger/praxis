//! The `Arrow` trait — type-level unification of pr4xis's 2-category cells.
//!
//! Per Mac Lane (1971) *Categories for the Working Mathematician* XII.3,
//! Cat is a 2-category whose 0-cells are categories, 1-cells are functors,
//! and 2-cells are natural transformations. Adjunctions are structured
//! 2-cell pairs. **Every cell at every dimension has a source, a target,
//! and a kind.** This trait names that shared shape.
//!
//! # Coverage
//!
//! - **Object-level morphisms** (`Category::Morphism`) — Arrow impl emitted
//!   by `pr4xis::ontology!` / `define_category!` alongside `Relationship`.
//! - **Functors** (1-cells in Cat) — Arrow via blanket `impl<F: Functor>`.
//! - **Adjunctions** (structured 2-cell pairs in Cat) — Arrow impl emitted
//!   by `pr4xis::adjunction!` and written manually for hand-rolled adjunctions.
//! - **Natural transformations** (2-cells in Cat) — Arrow impl via the
//!   `pr4xis::natural_transformation!` macro or manual.
//!
