// Yoneda lemma — the deepest result in category theory.
//
// For any functor F: C → Set and any object A in C:
//   Nat(Hom(A, -), F) ≅ F(A)
//
// In English: to know everything about an object A, it suffices to know
// all morphisms out of A. An object IS its relationships.
//
// In pr4xis, the Yoneda lemma is the formal basis for:
//   - morphisms_from(A): the representable functor Hom(A, -)
//   - morphisms_to(A): the co-representable functor Hom(-, A)
//   - Understanding an entity through its connections
//   - The "ontological identity" principle: an entity IS defined by
//     how it relates to everything else
//
// The Yoneda embedding: C → [C^op, Set] is full and faithful.
// This means no information is lost by viewing objects through morphisms.
