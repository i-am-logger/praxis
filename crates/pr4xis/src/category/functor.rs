/// A functor is a structure-preserving map between two categories.
///
/// Given categories C and D, a functor F: C → D maps:
/// - Objects of C to objects of D
/// - Morphisms of C to morphisms of D
///
/// # Laws
///
/// A valid functor must satisfy:
/// - **Identity preservation**: F(id_A) == id_{F(A)}
/// - **Composition preservation**: F(g∘f) == F(g)∘F(f)
///
/// Use [`crate::validate`] to verify these laws.
///
/// # Metadata + kind
///
/// Per Mac Lane (1971) XII.3, a functor is a 1-cell in the 2-category Cat.
/// Its metadata flows through the unified [`RelationshipMeta`] shape that
/// every arrow in pr4xis shares, and it carries a [`FunctorKind`] tag
/// (faithful / full / forgetful / free / ...) per the Gruber (1993) /
/// OBO-RO (Smith 2005) principle that every relation is formally-named.
