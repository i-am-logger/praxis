/// formally-named relations" — and OBO Relation Ontology (Smith et
/// al. 2005), every morphism carries a canonical relation-type. The
/// `Kind` associated type is that tag.
///
/// The kind enum is category-local (declared by `ontology!` or
/// `define_category!`), but its variant names conventionally match
/// concept names in the Relations umbrella ontology
/// (`formal::relations`) so structural axioms and the Lemon registry
/// can reason about relation kinds uniformly.
