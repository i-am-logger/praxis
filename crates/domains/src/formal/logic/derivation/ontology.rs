//! Derivation — the genus concept unifying proof and trace.
//!
//! A **derivation** is a structured record of how a conclusion is reached
//! from starting data. Under Curry-Howard (1958), the Hyland–Ong (2000)
//! game-semantics characterisation of PCF, and the traced-monoidal-categories
//! framework of Joyal–Street–Verity (1996), "proof" (atemporal validity
//! witness) and "trace" (temporal computation record) are two presentations
//! of the same underlying structure. This ontology names that underlying
//! structure.
//!
//! # Why this ontology exists
//!
//! pr4xis has historically split derivation-like records across two places:
//! `pr4xis::engine::Trace` (runtime enforcement record) and
//! `pr4xis-domains::…::diagnostics::PipelineTrace` (MAPE-K pipeline record).
//! And axioms returned `bool`, throwing away the derivation entirely. This
//! ontology provides the single literature-grounded vocabulary that all
//! three concepts (engine trace, pipeline trace, axiom proof) instantiate.
//!
//! # Literature
//!
//! - **Joyal, Street & Verity (1996)** *Traced Monoidal Categories*
//!   (Math. Proc. Cambridge Phil. Soc. 119: 447–468). Defines trace as a
//!   categorical operation on a monoidal category, producing morphisms
//!   with feedback — the abstract shape of "derivation with cycles".
//! - **Plotkin (1981)** *A Structural Approach to Operational Semantics*
//!   (DAIMI FN-19, Aarhus). Reduction sequences as derivations of end
//!   states from start states.
//! - **Mac Lane (1971)** *Categories for the Working Mathematician*
//!   Ch. II §1. Morphisms ARE derivations in the deductive category
//!   reading (made explicit in Lambek 1968).
//! - **Lambek (1968)** "Deductive Systems and Categories I"
//!   (Math. Systems Theory 2: 287–318). Proofs as morphisms in a category.
//! - **Curry & Feys (1958)** *Combinatory Logic* Vol. I. The
//!   propositions-as-types correspondence; derivations as inhabitants.
