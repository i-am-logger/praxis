// Event-driven system ontology.
//
// An event-driven system is one where state changes are triggered by events,
// not by direct command. Events are immutable facts about what happened.
// The system reacts to events, producing new events or state changes.
//
// This connects to:
// - DOLCE: events ARE perdurants (things that happen over time)
// - UFO-B: events have mereology (composition), causality, and correlation
// - Concurrency: events are the messages between concurrent agents
// - Systems thinking: events are transitions in the cybernetic loop
//
