//! Reverse object mapping: Pr4xisSubstrate → Syntrometry.
//!
//! The reverse direction *cannot* satisfy the strict `Functor` laws under
//! the current category structures — Pr4xisSubstrate is dense, Syntrometry
//! is kinded, and the #98 research note
//! (`docs/research/kinded-functor-failures.md`) established that dense
//! sources can't map into kinded targets via strict functors (self-loops
//! from non-identity compositions collapse to Identity in dense source but
//! would need Composed in kinded target). What *is* well-defined is the
//! **object mapping** — which substrate primitive each syntrometric
//! concept was implicitly claimed to live at by the forward lineage
//! functor. That's what powers the gap analysis in
//! [`crate::formal::meta::gap_analysis::analyze_syntrometry_substrate`].
//!
//! No `impl Functor` is provided; the `map_substrate` free function is
//! exposed for the gap analysis module to call directly. Attempting to
//! lift this into a full [`pr4xis::category::Functor`] would re-create the
//! failure mode documented in the research note.
