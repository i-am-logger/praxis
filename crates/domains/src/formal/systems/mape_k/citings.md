## Cross-references

- Workspace bibliography: [`docs/papers/references.md`](../../../../../../docs/papers/references.md)
- Research note: [`docs/research/pipeline-architecture-survey.md`](../../../../../../docs/research/pipeline-architecture-survey.md) — why MAPE-K was picked over 7 alternatives for the chat pipeline.
- Related workspace ontologies:
  - `formal::systems` — Wiener cybernetics; MAPE-K is a specific cybernetic feedback loop.
  - `cognitive::cognition::metacognition` — second-order monitoring; lives in the Monitor phase.
  - `cognitive::linguistics::pipeline` — the chat flow itself; the `PipelineStep → MapeK` functor proves it is a MAPE-K instance.
  - `cognitive::linguistics::pragmatics::planning` — speech-act planning; lives in the Plan phase (Bratman BDI as internal architecture).

## Pending verification

- [ ] Add Kephart & Chess 2003 to `docs/papers/references.md` if not already there.
- [ ] Consider encoding an explicit `BDI → MAPE-K::Plan` sub-functor so the Plan phase's internal architecture is literature-grounded too.
- [ ] Consider a `Reiter-Dale NLG → MAPE-K::Execute` sub-functor for the Execute phase's internal structure.
