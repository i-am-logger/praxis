// Metacognition — the system observing its own reasoning.
//
// Second-order cybernetics formalized: the observer IS part of the system.
// The meta-level monitors, evaluates, and controls the object level.
//
// When the grammar fails to parse, the meta-level:
// 1. Detects the failure (monitoring)
// 2. Diagnoses the cause (evaluation — which type reduction failed?)
// 3. Decides what to do (control — ask for clarification? attempt repair?)
