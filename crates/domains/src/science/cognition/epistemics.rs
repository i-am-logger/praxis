// Epistemics — what you know about what you know.
//
// The Rumsfeld matrix formalized as an ontology:
//   Known Known    — knowledge exists AND is accessible
//   Known Unknown  — absence of knowledge is detected
//   Unknown Known  — knowledge exists but is NOT accessible (ontology gap)
//   Unknown Unknown — absence is not even detectable
//
// Second-order cybernetics moves things between these states:
//   Self-observation turns Unknown Unknowns → Known Unknowns
//   Ontology repair turns Unknown Knowns → Known Knowns
//   Learning turns Known Unknowns → Known Knowns
//
// Open World Assumption:
//   Failure to find ≠ falsity. "I don't know" is a valid epistemic state.
