// Instance ontology — the Spivak instance functor formalized.
//
// An Instance is a functor I: Schema → Set — it populates a schema
// with actual data. For each entity type in the schema, the instance
// provides a set of individuals. For each morphism type, a function
// between those sets.
//
// This also models the three Spivak migration functors (Δ, Σ, Π)
// that transform instances along schema mappings, and the
// Presentation/Algebra duality from CQL.
