// Consistency ontology — the lattice of consistency models.
//
// Consistency models define what ordering guarantees a system provides
// for concurrent operations. They form a bounded lattice: stronger models
// are subsets of weaker models (every linearizable execution is also
// sequentially consistent, etc.).
