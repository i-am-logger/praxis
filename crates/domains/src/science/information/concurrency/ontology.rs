// Concurrency ontology — the science of simultaneous activity.
//
// Concurrency is not just "threads" — it's the fundamental concept of
// multiple agents acting on shared resources with coordination.
// Chess is concurrent: two players, one board, turn-taking.
// Traffic is concurrent: many cars, shared intersections, signal control.
// Conversation is concurrent: two speakers, shared discourse, turn-taking.
