//! Consciousness — C1 × C2 product (Dehaene, Lau & Kouider, Science 2017).
//!
//! Consciousness is TWO orthogonal dimensions, not one:
//!
//! C1 (Global Broadcasting): selection of information for global
//!    availability. GWT (Baars 1988). IIT (Tononi 2004) contributes
//!    the integration measure. This connects to the processing pipeline.
//!
//! C2 (Self-Monitoring): metacognitive monitoring of computations,
//!    leading to certainty/error. Higher-Order (Rosenthal 2005).
//!    This connects to metacognition.
//!
//! C1 and C2 are ORTHOGONAL. A system can have C1 without C2
//! (broadcasting without self-monitoring) or C2 without C1
//! (metacognitive assessment without global access).
//!
//! The consciousness ontology is the PRODUCT C1 × C2. Each component
//! has its own functor to downstream ontologies:
//!   π₁: Consciousness → Pipeline (via C1 broadcasting)
//!   π₂: Consciousness → Metacognition (via C2 self-monitoring)
//!
//! Source: Dehaene, Lau & Kouider, Science (2017);
//!         Tononi (2004, 2012); Baars (1988, 2005);
