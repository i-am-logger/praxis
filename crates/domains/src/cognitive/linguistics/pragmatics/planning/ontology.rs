//! Speech Act Planning — plan-based theory of speech acts.
//!
//! Speech acts are operators with epistemic preconditions and effects
//! on the hearer's mental state. Planning selects which speech acts to
//! perform based on communicative goals and the current epistemic state.
//!
//! Cohen & Perrault (1979): speech acts as STRIPS-like plan operators.
//! Appelt (1985): KAMP planner — intensional logic of knowledge and action.
//! Stalnaker (2002): assertion updates the Common Ground.
//! Bratman (1987): BDI — Belief + Desire + Intention → Plan.
//! Jakobson (1960): phatic function — social ritual, not information.
//!
//! This ontology bridges Epistemics → Response:
//!   Epistemics (what I know) → Planning (what to say) → Response (how to say it)
//!
