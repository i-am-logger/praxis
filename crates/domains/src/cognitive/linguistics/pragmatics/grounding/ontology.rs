//! Conversation Grounding — how participants establish mutual understanding.
//!
//! Grounding is the process by which conversational participants ensure
//! their contributions are understood. Every utterance must be grounded
//! before the conversation can advance — this is what distinguishes
//! dialogue from monologue.
//!
//! Clark & Schaefer (1989): contributions have two phases — presentation
//! and acceptance. The contribution is grounded when accepted.
//!
//! Clark "Using Language" (1996): grounding is a joint activity with
//! grounding criteria (evidence of understanding) that vary by medium.
//!
//! Traum (1994): computational grounding acts — acknowledge, continue,
//! initiate, repair, request clarification.
//!
//! Ginzburg "The Interactive Stance" (2012) KoS: information states,
//! dialogue gameboards, QUD (Questions Under Discussion) stack.
