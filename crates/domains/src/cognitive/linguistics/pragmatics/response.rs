// Response Generation ontology — the right adjoint of parsing.
//
// Parsing: Text → Syntax → Semantics (left adjoint, F)
// Generation: Semantics → Syntax → Text (right adjoint, G)
// Together: Parse ⊣ Generate (adjunction)
//
// The unit η: Id → G∘F means: parse then generate ≈ paraphrase.
// The counit ε: F∘G → Id means: generate then parse ≈ comprehension check.
// G∘F ≠ Id: paraphrase loses information (many texts → one meaning).
// F∘G ≠ Id: a meaning can be expressed many ways.
//
// This ontology defines the concepts for generating responses from
// ontological states. It composes:
// - Metacognition (what happened: gap, repair, clarification)
// - Epistemics (what the system knows: KK, KU, UK, UU)
// - SelfModel (what the system IS: components, capabilities)
// - Speech acts (what kind of response: assertion, question)
//
// The response is NOT a hardcoded string. It is composed from
// ontological concepts that are then realized through the Language.
